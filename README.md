Informational expert system just for fun.

## What is an expert system
The proper definition can be found on
[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system).
However, the informational expert system is not that typical.
Indeed, it acts more like a specific-purposed search engine,
with a stream of information on a specific field, the system provides
the nightly database and when every user asks, a brand new logic stack
(or logic model based on the user's mind view) will be created.
